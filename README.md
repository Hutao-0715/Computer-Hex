`MCTS-for-Hex` is a Hex solver base on Monte Carlo Tree Search and UCT formula. More explanation on https://hackmd.io/@yukicoder/Sy_irblGs. Though the example on the web site is a solver for Tic-tac-toe, the only difference is the `game` struct. Therefore you can change the function and variables in `game` and `TreeNode` to the board game you want to play. As long as the functions in them are still exist and working, it supose to be fine to play.
